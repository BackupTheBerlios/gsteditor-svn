GstEditor 0.0.1

This is the first version of a re-written GStreamer graphical pipeline 
editor.  This version was written from scratch to work with gstreamer 
0.10.x 


Requirements:

pygtk 2.8+
pygoocanvas 0.1 (SVN) - see http://pygoocanvas.berlios.de
goocanvas 0.3 (CVS) - required by pygoocanvas


Usage:

Create elements using the add button or by right clicking on the drawing 
area.  Connect pads by clicking on the pad and dragging to another pad.  
To adjust element parameters, double click or right click -> Configure 
Element on the element.  Elements can be moved around the screen with a 
left click, drag.  Delete elements with a right click -> Delete Element.


Some current known bugs:

- File save and open don't work.
- There's a bunch of debug output.
- Bins and pipelines within pipelines are not yet supported.
- occasionally, links are left on the drawing space despite the pads not 
being connected.
- links can only be deleted by removing an element
